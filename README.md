# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching Pets . Each Pet item can optionally have an attachment image. Each user only has access to Pet that he/she has created.

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless Pets application.
